    "DevOps Workflow Integration": "DevOps tools work together to create efficient software delivery pipelines:\n\n1. Developers collaborate using **Source Control** systems\n2. Changes trigger automated builds and tests through **CI/CD** pipelines\n3. Infrastructure is provisioned and configured via **Infrastructure Automation**\n4. Applications are deployed using **Containers** and orchestration platforms\n5. System health is tracked through **Monitoring & Observability** tools",
    "Modern DevOps Practices": "Key practices that underpin successful DevOps implementations:\n\n1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Managing infrastructure through version-controlled code\n2. **Continuous Integration**: Automatically testing code changes\n3. **Continuous Delivery**: Automating the release process\n4. **Microservices Architecture**: Building modular, independently deployable services\n5. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging\n6. **GitOps**: Using Git as the source of truth for declarative infrastructure"
