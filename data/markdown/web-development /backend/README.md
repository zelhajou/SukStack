## Backend Development Patterns & Architecture

Design patterns and architectural approaches for building scalable, maintainable backend systems.

### Microservices Architecture

| Pattern/Technology | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Service Discovery | Pattern for microservices to locate each other dynamically, implemented by tools like Consul, Eureka, and etcd |
| API Gateway | Component that acts as a single entry point for client applications to interact with a microservices architecture |
| Circuit Breaker | Pattern that prevents cascading failures by detecting failures and encapsulating the logic of preventing a failure from cascading |
| Saga Pattern | Sequence of local transactions in distributed systems where each transaction updates data within a single service |
| CQRS | Command Query Responsibility Segregation, separating read and write operations for better scalability and performance |
| Event Sourcing | Pattern where all changes to application state are stored as a sequence of events, providing auditing and temporal querying |
| Domain-Driven Design | Software development approach focusing on core domain, domain logic, and mapping to the business context |
| Bulkhead Pattern | Isolates elements of an application into pools so that if one fails, the others continue functioning |

### Serverless Architecture

| Pattern/Technology | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Function as a Service (FaaS) | Computing paradigm where logic runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered and fully managed by a third party |
| Backend for Frontend (BFF) | Pattern where a separate backend service is created for each user interface, optimizing data transfer |
| Event-Driven Processing | Architecture where functions or services are triggered by events rather than direct invocation |
| Choreography | Pattern where each service publishes events when something notable happens, and other services react to those events |
| Cold/Warm Start | Concepts related to the initialization time of serverless functions, affecting latency and performance |
| Step Functions | Workflow orchestration for serverless applications, coordinating multiple Lambda functions into complex workflows |
| API Composition | Pattern for retrieving data from multiple services where each service is responsible for specific data access |
| Fan-out/Fan-in | Pattern where a request is sent to multiple services in parallel and results are aggregated into a single response |

### Data Management Patterns

| Pattern/Technology | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Repository Pattern | Abstraction layer between the application and the database, providing a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects |
| Unit of Work | Maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction and coordinates the writing out of changes |
| CQRS | Command Query Responsibility Segregation, separating read and write operations for optimized performance |
| Polyglot Persistence | Using different data storage technologies for different types of data or workloads within an application |
| Data Access Object (DAO) | Pattern providing an abstract interface to a database or other persistence mechanism |
| Active Record | Pattern where an object carries both data and behavior, mapping to a single row in a database table |
| Data Mapper | Pattern where data objects and database are kept separate with a specific mapping layer between them |
| Cache-Aside | Cache pattern where the application is responsible for loading data into the cache and keeping it synchronized with the database |

### Scaling & Resilience

| Pattern/Technology | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Horizontal Scaling | Adding more machines/instances to a system to handle increased load |
| Vertical Scaling | Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine to handle increased load |
| Load Balancing | Distributing network traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability |
| Sharding | Partitioning data across multiple databases to improve performance and scalability |
| Retry Pattern | Enabling an application to retry an operation in anticipation of the operation eventually succeeding |
| Circuit Breaker | Pattern preventing a cascade of failures by detecting when a remote service is failing and stopping requests |
| Bulkhead | Isolating elements of an application into pools so one failure doesn't bring down the entire system |
| Throttling | Controlling the rate at which requests are processed to prevent overwhelming a system |
