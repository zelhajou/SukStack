# DevOps & Infrastructure

The foundation of modern software development, encompassing tools and practices that bridge development and operations. This ecosystem enables teams to automate infrastructure management, streamline code integration and deployment, monitor application performance, and collaborate effectively throughout the development lifecycle. DevOps practices focus on increasing deployment frequency, reducing time to market, and improving product quality through automation and feedback loops.
