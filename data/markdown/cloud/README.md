# Cloud Computing Solutions

The backbone of scalable, on-demand computing resources that power modern applications. Cloud platforms provide infrastructure, platform, and software services without the need to manage physical hardware. This ecosystem includes everything from major cloud providers offering comprehensive service catalogs to specialized serverless platforms, container orchestration systems, and edge computing networks that bring computation closer to end users.
