## Best Practices

- **Standardization**: Create standardized infrastructure templates and service catalogs
- **Automation**: Implement automation for provisioning, scaling, and lifecycle management
- **Resource Pooling**: Pool computing resources to maximize utilization and efficiency
- **Self-service**: Provide self-service portals for authorized users to request resources
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring for performance, capacity, and security
- **Chargeback**: Track resource usage for departmental billing or showback
- **Disaster Recovery**: Plan for business continuity with appropriate backup and recovery mechanisms
- **Capacity Planning**: Regularly review resource utilization and plan for future needs

## Integration with DevOps Workflows

Modern tools integrate seamlessly with other DevOps components to create efficient software delivery pipelines:

- **Network Infrastructure**: Integration with existing networking equipment and SDN solutions
- **Identity Systems**: Authentication and authorization linked with enterprise identity providers
- **Monitoring Tools**: Integration with existing monitoring and management solutions
- **DevOps Tools**: CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code tools
- **Public Cloud Services**: Hybrid connections to public cloud providers for additional capacity
