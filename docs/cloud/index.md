# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing delivers computing services over the internet, providing on-demand access to resources like computing power, storage, and databases without direct active management by the user. It enables businesses to scale resources elastically, optimize costs through a pay-as-you-go model, and focus on their core business rather than infrastructure management.

## Cloud Service Models

Cloud computing services are typically delivered through three primary models:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet (e.g., virtual machines, storage, networks)
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, typically for application development
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis

## Cloud Adoption Strategy

Successfully adopting cloud technologies requires:

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate current infrastructure and application portfolio
2. **Planning**: Develop a roadmap for migration and transformation
3. **Skills Development**: Train teams on cloud technologies and practices
4. **Governance**: Establish policies for cost management, security, and compliance
5. **Operations**: Implement cloud-native operations and monitoring
