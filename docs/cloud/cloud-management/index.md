## Best Practices

- **Resource Tagging**: Implement consistent tagging for resources to enable detailed cost allocation and governance
- **Right-sizing**: Continuously evaluate and optimize resource sizes based on actual usage patterns
- **Reserved Instances**: Use reserved or committed-use instances for predictable workloads to reduce costs
- **Auto-scaling**: Implement auto-scaling to match resource allocation with demand
- **Policy-based Management**: Create and enforce governance policies for cloud resource usage
- **Cloud Center of Excellence**: Establish a cross-functional team to govern cloud adoption and best practices
- **Automated Remediation**: Set up automated responses to security events and cost anomalies
- **Continuous Compliance**: Regularly verify compliance with standards and regulations
