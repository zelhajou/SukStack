## Best Practices

- **Observability by Design**: Build applications with monitoring in mind from the start
- **SLOs and SLIs**: Define clear service level objectives and indicators
- **The Four Golden Signals**: Monitor latency, traffic, errors, and saturation
- **Structured Logging**: Use consistent, machine-parseable log formats
- **Correlation IDs**: Implement request tracing across services with correlation IDs
- **Actionable Alerts**: Design alerts that provide clear context and remediation steps
- **Dashboards**: Create intuitive dashboards for different personas (operators, developers, business)
- **Alert Fatigue**: Minimize noise by eliminating redundant or non-actionable alerts

## Integration with DevOps Workflows

Modern tools integrate seamlessly with other DevOps components to create efficient software delivery pipelines:

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automatically deploy monitoring with application changes
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Define monitoring configuration as code
- **Incident Response**: Connect alerts to on-call rotations and incident management workflows
- **Kubernetes**: Monitor container orchestration with specialized tools
- **Service Mesh**: Leverage service mesh telemetry for deeper insights
