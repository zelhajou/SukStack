# Source Control Management Systems

Essential tools for tracking and managing changes to code repositories. Source control systems enable developers to collaborate efficiently, maintain code history, and manage releases.

## [Git Repository Hosting Platforms](git-platform/)

Services that host Git repositories with additional collaboration features

| Tool | Logo | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [GitHub](https://github.com) | ![GitHub Logo](/logos/devops/source-control/github.png) | Web-based hosting service for Git repositories offering collaboration features like pull requests, actions for CI/CD, project boards, and security scanning |
| [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) | ![GitLab Logo](/logos/devops/source-control/gitlab.png) | Web-based DevOps platform that provides Git repository management with CI/CD pipelines, issue tracking, and extensive DevOps features in a complete application |


## Best Practices

- **Commit frequently** with clear, descriptive messages that explain why changes were made
- **Branch strategically** with a consistent workflow like Gitflow or trunk-based development
- **Review code** through pull/merge requests before integrating into shared branches
- **Automate testing** with pre-commit hooks or CI pipelines to maintain code quality
- **Tag releases** to create clear markers for deployed versions
- **Maintain a clean history** through techniques like rebasing or squashing when appropriate
- **Document conventions** for your team regarding branching, commit messages, and workflow

## Integration with DevOps Workflows

Modern tools integrate seamlessly with other DevOps components to create efficient software delivery pipelines:

- **Continuous Integration** automatically builds and tests code on commit
- **Continuous Delivery** deploys validated code to staging environments
- **Infrastructure as Code** tracks infrastructure definitions alongside application code
- **Security Scanning** identifies vulnerabilities during the commit process
- **Code Quality Tools** enforce standards and catch potential issues early
