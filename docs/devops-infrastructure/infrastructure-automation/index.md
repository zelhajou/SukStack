# Infrastructure Automation

Infrastructure automation tools enable teams to define, deploy, and manage infrastructure using code instead of manual processes, ensuring consistency and scalability while reducing human error.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tools

Tools for defining and provisioning infrastructure using declarative configurations

| Tool | Logo | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) | ![AWS CloudFormation Logo](/logos/devops/infrastructure-automation/cloudformation.png) | AWS service for modeling and provisioning cloud resources using infrastructure as code templates in JSON or YAML format |
| [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) | ![Pulumi Logo](/logos/devops/infrastructure-automation/pulumi.png) | Open-source infrastructure as code tool that allows developers to define infrastructure using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Go, and C# |
| [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) | ![Terraform Logo](/logos/devops/infrastructure-automation/terraform.png) | Open-source infrastructure as code software tool that enables defining and provisioning infrastructure across multiple cloud providers using declarative configuration files |

## Configuration Management

Tools for automating the configuration of servers and infrastructure resources

| Tool | Logo | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) | ![Ansible Logo](/logos/devops/infrastructure-automation/ansible.png) | Open-source automation tool for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation using a simple YAML syntax called playbooks |
| [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) | ![Chef Logo](/logos/devops/infrastructure-automation/chef.png) | Configuration management tool that uses Ruby-based DSL to write system configurations as code, ensuring servers are consistently configured across the infrastructure |
| [Puppet](https://puppet.com/) | ![Puppet Logo](/logos/devops/infrastructure-automation/puppet.png) | Configuration management tool that automates the provisioning and management of infrastructure using a declarative language to define system configurations |
| [SaltStack](https://saltproject.io/) | ![SaltStack Logo](/logos/devops/infrastructure-automation/saltstack.png) | Configuration management and remote execution tool that uses a high-speed data bus to communicate with nodes and provides real-time system updates |

## Cloud Orchestration

Platforms for orchestrating complex cloud infrastructure deployments

| Tool | Logo | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [Cloudify](https://cloudify.co/) | ![Cloudify Logo](/logos/devops/infrastructure-automation/cloudify.png) | Open-source cloud orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and lifecycle management of applications across multiple cloud environments |
| [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) | ![Crossplane Logo](/logos/devops/infrastructure-automation/crossplane.png) | Open-source Kubernetes add-on that extends the Kubernetes API to provision and manage cloud infrastructure and services using Kubernetes custom resources |

## Service Mesh

Infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication for microservices

| Tool | Logo | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [HashiCorp Consul](https://www.consul.io/) | ![HashiCorp Consul Logo](/logos/devops/infrastructure-automation/consul.png) | Service networking platform providing service discovery, configuration, and segmentation functionality with a service mesh solution |
| [Istio](https://istio.io/) | ![Istio Logo](/logos/devops/infrastructure-automation/istio.png) | Open-source service mesh that provides a uniform way to connect, secure, control, and observe microservices across Kubernetes clusters |
| [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) | ![Linkerd Logo](/logos/devops/infrastructure-automation/linkerd.png) | Lightweight service mesh for Kubernetes that adds security, observability, and reliability to applications without requiring any code changes |


## Best Practices

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Define all infrastructure using code to ensure consistency and reproducibility
- **Version Control**: Store infrastructure code in version control systems for tracking changes
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Deploy new instances rather than modifying existing ones
- **Environment Parity**: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible
- **Modular Design**: Create reusable modules for common infrastructure patterns
- **Automated Testing**: Test infrastructure code before applying changes
- **Least Privilege**: Use role-based access control for infrastructure management

## Integration with DevOps Workflows

Modern tools integrate seamlessly with other DevOps components to create efficient software delivery pipelines:

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate infrastructure deployments via continuous integration/delivery pipelines
- **Container Platforms**: Provision and configure Kubernetes clusters and orchestration systems
- **Monitoring Tools**: Set up monitoring and observability automatically for newly provisioned resources
- **Source Control**: Track infrastructure changes alongside application code
- **Secret Management**: Securely store and distribute credentials and secrets
